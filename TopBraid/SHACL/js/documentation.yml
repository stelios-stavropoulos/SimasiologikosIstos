    description: |
      These classes are instantiated by the graph API to represent RDF nodes.
      The root class GraphNode has the two subclasses NamedNode (for URIs and blank nodes) and LiteralNode (for literal values such as xsd:date nodes).
      Note that the most common literal types (xsd:string, xsd:boolean and numeric types) are typically represented by simple JavaScript values
      (strings, booleans and numbers).
